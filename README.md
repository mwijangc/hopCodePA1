# README - INF 124 PA 1

## General Layout

We implemented a navigation bar at the top of the screen to navigate between pages. Clicking on 'Home' will send you to the home page of the site, where you can see a hero banner, the group of three that worked on it (Mikey Wijangco, Becky Dinh, and Jules Labador), and a button to navigate to the products page. Tapping on the 'Frogs' button in the navigation bar the button that says 'SEE THE PRODUCTS' will bring you to the same page.

## Requirements
1. Overview - can be found on page 1 of the home page.
2. List of products - found on the products page. On desktop it's in a table with 5 columns and 2 rows.
3. Each product has a unique image on the products page.
4. Each product displays a rating and price.
5. Clicking on a product will navigate the user to the product-info page, where they can view more information such as the description, attributes, and additional details.
6. When on the product-info page, tapping on the 'Fill out purchase form' button will bring up a form where the user can enter in the necessary information to purchase a product.
7. Hitting the submit button on the form will bring up the user's client-side software, autofillled with information they filled out in the form.
8. Each field in the form properly checks for correct formatting before submission.
9. CSS is used throughout the website to style and lay out each element on each page.
10. Resizing the site to a smaller window will adjust elements on the screen, making it responsive and mobile-friendly.
11. Hovering over a product in the products page will expand the cell, bringing the user's focus to that product.
